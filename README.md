Mikko's stupid optimizing Tensor Library
----------------------------------------

yes good tensors mm yes

Goals
-----

 * An interpreted Haskell backend
 * A Vulkan backend
 * Enough features to run some neural networks
 * Competetive performance compared to torch and some graph-based tensor
   libraries
 * Should work on NVidia cards, CPU and M1.
 * If there's a Vulkan backend, would it work through MoltenVk on Apple?
 * If I find a way to test on AMD card, I will test on AMD card
 * Idiomatic-Haskell type API on top of the "program" API I started
